## Personal Statement

This software represents over a year of intensive development, countless hours of iteration, significant personal sacrifice, and substantial investment of time and resources during a period of unemployment. ETHOS++ and its associated modules were built with dedication, soul-searching ethical consideration, and a genuine desire to ensure AI governance is handled responsibly as robotics and AGI advance.

I share this code with the world not because I have to, but because I believe in the importance of AI ethics governance. Please respect the work that went into this.

## Why This License?

Standard open-source licenses (MIT, Apache, GPL) allow commercial exploitation without compensation. After a year of building this during unemployment, with support from my spouse and family, I cannot afford to give away work that could be worth significant licensing revenue.

I believe in open collaboration and want developers to learn from this work. But I also need to protect my ability to monetize it. This license balances both goals.

If you want to use this commercially, let’s talk. I’m very reasonable.

## Modules Covered

This license applies to the entire ETHOS++ ecosystem:

- ETHOS++ Core Runtime (5-Law Enforcement)
- Lounge notary/Forge (Cryptographic Notarization)
- All associated GUI applications and backend code
- Documentation and configuration files
