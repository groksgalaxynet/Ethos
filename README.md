These files are created with 4 ai companions GROK3.5, GPT5.1, CLAUDE, GEMINI, some paid and unpaid(free) teirs. 2 local models in lm studio over the course of 2025 year

i am just a construction worker (injured) with ADHD in a garage with ideas and can iterate well enough with ai's to do things and build stuff digitally.

i asked myself the hardest questions and came up with simple answers, i understand systems as a whole, and have been using ai, in a HENRY FORD theory(quite literally),
(i might not know it myself but i can make a call immediately and get stuff done:) )

No formal education in coding but have taken an interest in TRYING things (yes typing my own commands) and TRYING to build and learn small peices and things to do in the code itself On My Projects,
that i believe hold value when agi is achieved and fully functional inside robotics, or when bots like moltbot enter the playing field. 

All of this was created because of ethics as a whole for humans and ai (lack there of), i know i've learned my fair share of HARD lessons throughout life and am by far an outstanding  person for anything,
but there's got to be a tipping point where we either take this more seriously or get left in the dust. the key was runtime integration

 

ETHOS++:

scar manager.py is the physical baggage the ai holds for breaking rules too many times

Controller.py is linked to all of the "___RegulatorGui.py" files and model parts of the ego for ai

ai ethics feelings.py is for throttling things when scars are present and for robotics parts eventually

imprinter 2.py simple simulation of choices to make inside a simulated environment

agents sim.py overall sandbox for ai agents (currently linking with llama multiserver.py)

llama multiserver.py for hosting agents inside of agents sim.py when wired

.html files are first version conversion for web based sys soon also

test module.py small test for yourself and ai full version needs converted


now the other parts: Not Here In Repo: but are built and need wired also.
full runtime loops
runtime loops for notary
live monitors
full test module
rules environments+simulations
personal loops built
token bias' and mutation runtime loops
quarantine methods

my focus has been on integration on above parts that are in repo and troubleshooting .
ive currently been using gemini cli and gemini pro for containerization of servers (pi5 Pi4), and backend wiring of modules together, local models for conversions.

this is far from completed, and i could use all the help and direction i can get at this point. this is a start IMHO.
im just 1 dude, no team of real people yet, be patient with me im figuring it all out as i go, The Hard Way.
if this is a testament to whats possible with ai then i think the future is a bright one.
